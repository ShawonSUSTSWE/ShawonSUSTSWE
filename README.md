# Hello WORLD!!
I am Mohammed Mazhar Ali Shawon. I'm Currently Studying Software Engineering at Shahjalal University of Science & Technology, Sylhet. Since I was little I was always fascinated by Computers. I played games on my computer since I was 5. I watched movies about hackers being cool in the movies and wanted to be in IT sector. Never thought in my life that I would actually get to study Software Enginnering when I grew up.
